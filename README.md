 ## Overall Description 

 This command line interface application is still in the early stages of development, its overall purpose is to be able to interact with and manipulate a SQL database that has been set up to keep track of employee information. Eventually this CLI will be converted into an API and hooked up to a responsive front end. Current features include the ability to Add, Delete, and View the information stored in the database tables. 
 Some features that still need to be completed are the ability to Edit and Sort the stored data.

 

 ## Installation Instructions

 This application depends on inquirer MySQL2 and Console Table. As long as you have Node.js installed you should be able to install the packages via NPM with the command npm install and everything should run quite nicely. If not, feel free to open an issue. Also dont forget to start up a new server before using the application. The schema ans seeds files can be found in the db folder. 

 ## Instructions/How To Use
 
 It's pretty straight forward. Just follow the prompts after launching the application.

 Some of the options include viewing all data in the employees, departments, and roles tables. Currently you are able to view add and delete, other functions such as edit and sort are in the works. Once everything is done fully functional the next step of this project will be a responsive front end to facilitate ease of use. 

 

 ## Contribution Guidelines
 If you would like to contribute to the project, feel free to do so. Some things to keep in mind:

 1. Please use structured/formatted commit messages that adhere to the following guideline: git commit -m "{the date of the commit}" -m "{detailed description of the changes}" -m "{who is making the commit}"
 for now this is just a personal preference to keep the repository nice and tidy, eventually these guidelines will be updated to reflect whatever version nomenclature i decide to use. 

 2. Do Not open a pull request on the main branch, it will be denied. period. Start a new feature branch or open a pull request to develop so your contributions can be reviewed first. 

 3. Comment your code, since I didn't write your code i might not know right away what it does. Please keep your code clean, tidy, and well commented to make integration of features more seamless. 

 4. if you'd like to be a regular contributor reach out and ask to be a collaborator,
